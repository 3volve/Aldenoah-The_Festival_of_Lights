# Aldenoah-The_Festival_of_Lights
This is the game I made over a six-month period.  I made the entirety of the game in Unity by myself, with only art, music and models gotten from other sources.
This game is a small story-based introduction to the world of Aldenoah that I've slowly built up in my head over the last decade or so.
It's short and simple such that anyone of any amount of experience playing games should be able to play and finish it.
(I even tested this on my 74 year-old technology illiterate dad).


If I've linked you to this, then I wanted to give you a place for a free download of my game.

I hope you enjoy!
