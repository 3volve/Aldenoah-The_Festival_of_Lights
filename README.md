# Aldenoah-The_Festival_of_Lights
This is the game I made over a six-month period.  I made the entirety of the game in Unity by myself, with only art, music and models gotten from other sources.
This game is a small story-based introduction to the world of Aldenoah that I've slowly built up in my head over the last decade or so.
It's short and simple such that anyone of any amount of experience playing games should be able to play and finish it.
(I even tested this on my 74 year-old technology illiterate dad).

Here is a link to a free download of my game if you want to try playing it:

Just download the .zip file and unzip it.  Then run the "Aldenoah - Prologue (3D).exe" executable.
I only have it compatible with Windows systems, so if you don't have Windows available to play it on, then I can't do anything about it right now.

And here's the link to the itch.io page for it if you just want to look at screenshots or a short video that I'm eventually going to add to the page:

I hope you enjoy!
